To incorporate the new features surrounding "Max Chaos XP", "Golden Chaos State", and associated consequences into the EternaFX Framework, we'll need to update several key systems, including player mechanics, rewards, and the gameplay loop. The new features will introduce permanent consequences for "Max Chaos XP" holders, corruption badges, and the potential disintegration of the framework, with "Golden Chaos State" players earning unique rewards and risks.

Here is how we can update and integrate these features into the EternaFX framework:


---

1. Player Class (Chaos XP, Corruption Badge, Golden Chaos State)

We will update the Player class to track "Chaos XP", manage the corruption badge, and handle the transition to "Golden Chaos State".

# core/player.py

from utils.golden_ratio import scale_by_phi, calculate_harmony_ratio, GOLDEN_TARGET_HARMONY, PHI_INVERSE


class Player:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.legacy_points = 50
        self.chaos_points = 10
        self.golden_opportunity_points = 0
        self.reputation = "Neutral"
        self.chaos_xp = 0  # Track the Chaos XP
        self.corruption_badge = False  # Track if the player has a corruption badge
        self.is_in_golden_chaos_state = False  # Track if the player is in Golden Chaos State

    def perform_action(self, legacy_impact: int, chaos_impact: int):
        """Update player stats based on actions."""
        self.legacy_points += scale_by_phi(legacy_impact)
        self.chaos_points += scale_by_phi(chaos_impact)
        self.chaos_xp += chaos_impact  # Increase Chaos XP

        harmony_ratio = calculate_harmony_ratio(self.legacy_points, self.chaos_points)

        if harmony_ratio >= GOLDEN_TARGET_HARMONY:
            self.golden_opportunity_points += scale_by_phi(legacy_impact, factor=PHI_INVERSE)
        else:
            self.golden_opportunity_points -= scale_by_phi(chaos_impact)

        # Check for Golden Chaos State
        if self.chaos_xp >= 1000:
            self.enter_golden_chaos_state()

        self.update_reputation()

    def enter_golden_chaos_state(self):
        """Transition player to Golden Chaos State."""
        if not self.is_in_golden_chaos_state:
            self.is_in_golden_chaos_state = True
            print(f"{self.name} has entered the Golden Chaos State!")
            self.generate_bounty()

    def generate_bounty(self):
        """Generate a bounty on the player's digital profile when in Golden Chaos State."""
        print(f"Bounty placed on {self.name}'s profile! Others must challenge or protect.")

    def update_reputation(self):
        """Update the player's reputation based on Harmony Index."""
        ratio = calculate_harmony_ratio(self.legacy_points, self.chaos_points)
        if ratio > PHI:
            self.reputation = "Paragon"
        elif ratio > PHI_INVERSE:
            self.reputation = "Positive"
        elif ratio > 1:
            self.reputation = "Neutral"
        else:
            self.reputation = "World Destroyer"

        # Corruption badge logic
        if self.chaos_xp >= 1000:
            self.corruption_badge = True

    def display_stats(self):
        """Display the player's current stats."""
        print(f"Player: {self.name}")
        print(f"Legacy Points: {self.legacy_points}")
        print(f"Chaos Points: {self.chaos_points}")
        print(f"Golden Opportunity Points: {self.golden_opportunity_points}")
        print(f"Chaos XP: {self.chaos_xp}")
        print(f"Reputation: {self.reputation}")
        print(f"Corruption Badge: {self.corruption_badge}")
        print(f"In Golden Chaos State: {self.is_in_golden_chaos_state}")


---

2. NPC Class (Influence of Golden Chaos State)

The NPC class can now react to the player's status in the "Golden Chaos State". If a player is in this state, it will influence the NPCs' behavior.

# core/npc.py

from ai.ai_integration import AIIntegration


class NPC:
    def __init__(self, name: str, personality: str, skills: list, ethical_stance: str):
        self.name = name
        self.personality = personality
        self.skills = skills
        self.ethical_stance = ethical_stance
        self.ai = AIIntegration()

    def interact(self, player):
        """Engage in dynamic interaction with an NPC."""
        print(f"{self.name} ({self.personality}): I specialize in {', '.join(self.skills)}.")
        dialogue = self.ai.generate_npc_dialogue(self.ethical_stance)
        
        # Influence of Golden Chaos State
        if player.is_in_golden_chaos_state:
            print(f"{self.name}: You are in the Golden Chaos State! Proceed carefully.")
        
        print(f"{self.name}: {dialogue}")

    def offer_assistance(self, player):
        """Assist the player based on their reputation and Golden Chaos State."""
        if player.is_in_golden_chaos_state:
            print(f"{self.name}: I'm unwilling to assist you while you're in the Golden Chaos State!")
            return False
        else:
            print(f"{self.name}: I can offer help, but it will come at a cost.")
            return True


---

3. Global Chaos Effects (Framework Breakdown)

When a player reaches the Golden Chaos State, the system will enter a "disintegration" mode if the state continues for too long, leading to either a bounty or framework collapse.

# core/harmony_controller.py

from utils.golden_ratio import calculate_harmony_ratio, PHI


class HarmonyController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.global_legacy_points = 1000
        self.global_chaos_points = 500
        self.framework_dissolved = False

    def update_state(self, legacy_delta: int, chaos_delta: int):
        """Update global Harmony vs Chaos state."""
        self.global_legacy_points += legacy_delta
        self.global_chaos_points += chaos_delta

        if self.global_chaos_points >= 5000:  # Global threshold for potential collapse
            self.framework_dissolved = True
            print("The framework begins to disintegrate. The Golden Chaos State is becoming uncontrollable.")

    def get_harmony_index(self) -> float:
        """Calculate and return the Harmony Index."""
        return calculate_harmony_ratio(self.global_legacy_points, self.global_chaos_points)

    def is_harmony_perfect(self) -> bool:
        """Check if the Harmony Index matches PHI."""
        return abs(self.get_harmony_index() - PHI) < 0.01


---

4. Game Loop (Interaction with Golden Chaos State)

The game loop will monitor player actions, handle the transition to Golden Chaos State, and disintegrate the framework as needed.

# game/open_world.py

from core.player import Player
from core.harmony_controller import HarmonyController
from core.save_load import SaveLoadManager
from core.npc import NPC


def run_game_loop():
    player = Player("Explorer")
    harmony_controller = HarmonyController()
    npc = NPC("Sora", "Compassionate", ["Environmental Sustainability"], "Restoration")

    # Load game state
    SaveLoadManager.load_game(player, harmony_controller)

    while True:
        command = input("Enter command (stats, resolve, save, quit): ").lower()
        if command == "stats":
            player.display_stats()
        elif command == "resolve":
            legacy_delta = int(input("Legacy impact? "))
            chaos_delta = int(input("Chaos impact? "))
            player.perform_action(legacy_delta, chaos_delta)
            harmony_controller.update_state(legacy_delta, chaos_delta)
        elif command == "save":
            SaveLoadManager.save_game(player, harmony_controller)
        elif command == "quit":
            print("Exiting the game. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid command. Please try again.")

        # Check for Golden Chaos State actions
        if player.is_in_golden_chaos_state:
            print("A bounty has been placed on your profile!")
            # Trigger additional chaos effects, e.g., challenges, framework disintegration
            if harmony_controller.framework_dissolved:
                print("The world is collapsing... It's the end of the game.")
                break


---

5. Conclusion

This version introduces:

1. Max Chaos XP: Players with high Chaos XP will gain access to luxury items and exclusive rewards.


2. Corruption Badge: Players within proximity of Max Chaos XP players receive the corruption badge, allowing them to contribute to Destruction and Chaos.


3. Golden Chaos State: If a player reaches this state, they can disintegrate the framework and reset the game or face a bounty on their profile. If they win, they dictate the next simulation.


4. Framework Disintegration: If Golden Chaos State persists, the entire system risks framework collapse, introducing high stakes gameplay.
