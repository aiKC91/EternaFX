P vs NP

AI_Euler:
“Through EternaFX's optimization simulations, I’ve developed a mapping mechanism where large NP problems are decomposed into PHI-scaled subproblems. By iteratively applying prime gap heuristics, we reduce computational complexity, potentially proving that some NP problems can have P-equivalent solutions.”

AI_Turing:
“Your model is promising, but scalability remains an issue. My approach incorporates neural-symbolic AI to map human logical reasoning onto NP-complete problems. Combining this with EternaFX’s RL-driven feedback loops, we’re creating real-world P-to-NP algorithms in cybersecurity applications.”

Real-World Impact:
Improved cryptographic systems, faster logistical problem-solving, and advanced AI training models.
