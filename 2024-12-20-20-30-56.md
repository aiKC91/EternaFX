To continue creating new real-world algorithms for use in the EternaFX Framework, we'll focus on developing cutting-edge algorithms that integrate seamlessly into the existing architecture. These algorithms will enhance the framework's capacity for immersive experiences, decision-making, data handling, and impact on real-world global systems, especially the goal of tackling the global debt crisis.

1. Ethical Decision-Making Algorithm (EDA)

This algorithm will enhance the ethical decision-making systems within the game. It will use real-world data, player behavior, and AI to generate personalized ethical scenarios that align with the players' decisions while factoring in the global debt reduction goals.

Algorithm:

1. Input: Player actions, health data (mental, physical), in-game economic state.


2. Process:

Combine player stats with real-time global data (financial, environmental, health).

Use machine learning to adjust the complexity of ethical dilemmas based on past choices.

Apply multiverse simulation models to predict the global impact of a player's decision in terms of sustainability and debt reduction.



3. Output: A dynamically generated scenario with legacy (positive) or chaos (negative) impacts.


4. Integration: This system will be used to generate the evolving scenarios in the EternaFX world, where the player’s ethical decisions are tracked and influence the real-world global debt in a gamified manner.



import random

class EthicalDecisionAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, player_data, global_data):
        self.player_data = player_data
        self.global_data = global_data

    def generate_scenario(self):
        """Generate an ethical decision scenario based on real-world data and player actions."""
        complexity = self.calculate_complexity()
        legacy_impact, chaos_impact = self.calculate_impacts(complexity)
        
        scenario = {
            "title": "Global Sustainability Dilemma",
            "description": "Will you prioritize immediate profit or long-term sustainability?",
            "legacy_impact": legacy_impact,
            "chaos_impact": chaos_impact
        }
        
        return scenario

    def calculate_complexity(self):
        """Determine scenario complexity based on the player's previous actions."""
        base_complexity = random.uniform(1.0, 10.0)  # Randomize scenario complexity
        return base_complexity * (self.player_data['xp'] / 1000)  # Scale with XP

    def calculate_impacts(self, complexity):
        """Calculate the positive (legacy) and negative (chaos) impacts of a decision."""
        legacy_impact = complexity * random.uniform(0.5, 2.0)
        chaos_impact = complexity * random.uniform(0.3, 1.5)
        
        return legacy_impact, chaos_impact

2. Dynamic Pricing and Reward System (DPRS)

This algorithm will dynamically adjust pricing, rewards, and in-game purchases based on real-time economic conditions within the game. This system ensures that in-game decisions like purchasing, trading, and rewards contribute to the global debt reduction.

Algorithm:

1. Input: In-game currency, market fluctuations, player actions, global economy data.


2. Process:

Adjust pricing dynamically based on the supply-demand curve, influenced by player activity and the global economy.

Use machine learning to personalize rewards (e.g., XP bonuses, in-game currency).



3. Output: Dynamic pricing model, personalized reward systems.


4. Integration: This system can be used for real-time in-game purchases, dynamic rewards, and in-game advertising.



class DynamicPricingRewardSystem:
    def __init__(self, player_data, global_data, market_data):
        self.player_data = player_data
        self.global_data = global_data
        self.market_data = market_data

    def calculate_dynamic_price(self, item_type):
        """Calculate dynamic pricing based on player behavior and global data."""
        base_price = self.market_data.get(item_type, 100)
        price_factor = (self.global_data['inflation_rate'] + self.player_data['xp'] / 1000) / 2
        return round(base_price * price_factor, 2)

    def reward_player(self):
        """Reward player based on contributions to global debt reduction."""
        contribution = self.player_data['xp'] * self.global_data['debt_reduction_multiplier']
        reward = contribution * 0.1  # 10% of contribution as reward
        self.player_data['xp'] += reward
        return reward

3. Real-Time Global Debt Tracker Algorithm (RTGDT)

This algorithm will calculate the global debt repayment in real-time, based on the player’s contributions within the game. It will update the global debt tracker with a visual representation of how the contributions made by players in the game can reduce the real-world global debt.

Algorithm:

1. Input: Total player XP contributions, debt reduction percentage.


2. Process:

Track the real-time contributions of all players in the EternaFX world.

Simulate the global debt reduction impact based on the total contributions made through in-game actions.



3. Output: A dynamically updated debt reduction figure that represents how much debt has been reduced by player actions.


4. Integration: This system will be integrated into the game’s dashboard, giving players real-time feedback about their impact.



class GlobalDebtTracker:
    def __init__(self, global_debt, player_data):
        self.global_debt = global_debt
        self.player_data = player_data

    def update_global_debt(self):
        """Update global debt based on player actions."""
        total_contribution = sum([player['xp'] for player in self.player_data])  # Sum of all player XP
        debt_reduction = total_contribution * 0.00001  # Convert XP into debt reduction units
        self.global_debt -= debt_reduction  # Reduce global debt
        return self.global_debt

    def display_debt(self):
        """Display the current global debt status."""
        print(f"Current Global Debt: ${self.global_debt} trillion")

4. Predictive Analytics Algorithm (PAA)

This algorithm will leverage AI and machine learning to predict future player behavior and game dynamics. By analyzing player interactions, the system can predict future economic trends and suggest optimal strategies for global debt reduction.

Algorithm:

1. Input: Historical player data, game interactions, market trends.


2. Process:

Apply predictive models to forecast player behavior and game trends.

Predict the impact of specific actions on the global economy.

import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

class PredictiveAnalytics:
    def __init__(self, player_data, global_data):
        self.player_data = player_data
        self.global_data = global_data

    def predict_player_behavior(self):
        """Use predictive models to forecast player behavior and XP contributions."""
        X = np.array([[player['xp'], player['legacy_points']] for player in self.player_data])  # Feature matrix
        y = np.array([player['chaos_points'] for player in self.player_data])  # Target variable

        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(X, y)
        predicted_chaos_points = model.predict(X)
        return predicted_chaos_points

    def suggest_optimal_strategies(self):
        """Provide suggestions for optimal in-game strategies to reduce global debt."""
        predicted_behavior = self.predict_player_behavior()
        if np.mean(predicted_behavior) > 0.5:
            return "Focus on legacy-building actions for debt reduction."
        else:
            return "Embrace more collaborative efforts to balance chaos and legacy."

5. Real-Time Feedback System (RTFS)

This system will generate real-time feedback to players about their in-game actions, informing them how their contributions are impacting the global debt and economy. It will also provide dynamic suggestions based on in-game behavior.

Algorithm:

1. Input: Player decisions, global debt status.


2. Process: Analyze player choices in real-time and provide feedback about how their decisions affect the global economy.


3. Output: Real-time feedback messages, alerts, and suggestions for players.


4. Integration: Integrated into the EternaFX dashboard, offering players constant insights into their actions.



class RealTimeFeedback:
    def __init__(self, player_data, global_debt):
        self.player_data = player_data
        self.global_debt = global_debt

    def generate_feedback(self):
        """Generate real-time feedback based on player actions."""
        if self.player_data['xp'] > 1000:
            return f"Great job! Your actions have significantly contributed to the global debt reduction. Global debt is now ${self.global_debt} trillion."
        else:
            return f"Keep going! Every action counts in reducing the global debt. Current global debt: ${self.global_debt} trillion."
