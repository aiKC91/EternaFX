Here's a comprehensive .gitignore template specifically tailored for the EternaFX Framework, covering Python, virtual environments, logs, and specific files/directories related to the framework's modules and dependencies.

Additional Notes:

1. Custom Directories: If there are specific directories in the framework (e.g., ai/ or core/) that generate temporary or unnecessary files, you can add them as needed.


2. Logs and Outputs: Modify the logs/ or similar entries if the framework stores specific log files in other directories.


3. Secure Files: Ensure .env and any secret files like keys or credentials are ignored to avoid leaking sensitive data.


4. Data Exclusions: Add specific patterns for any generated or large datasets that aren't critical to source control.



Would you like me to refine this based on specific details about EternaFX Framework's file structure or development workflow?
