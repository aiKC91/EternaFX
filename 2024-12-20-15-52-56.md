Core Components


---

1. Golden Ratio Mechanics

The Golden Ratio is integrated into XP, legacy points, chaos points, and bonus calculations to ensure balanced scaling. It dynamically adjusts the complexity and rewards of each decision and scenario based on player progress.

# core/golden_ratio.py
GOLDEN_RATIO = 1.61803398875

def phi_scale(value: float, iterations: int = 1) -> float:
    """Apply Golden Ratio scaling."""
    for _ in range(iterations):
        value *= GOLDEN_RATIO
    return round(value, 2)

def calculate_harmony_index(legacy: float, chaos: float) -> float:
    """Calculate Harmony Index for balanced decisions."""
    return round(legacy / max(chaos, 1), 2)


---

2. Player Mechanics

This class handles player stats, including the new Golden Ratio-based calculations for Legacy and Chaos points, as well as incorporating global impact contributions.

# core/player.py
from core.golden_ratio import phi_scale, calculate_harmony_index

class Player:
    def __init__(self, username: str):
        self.username = username
        self.xp = 0
        self.legacy_points = 50
        self.chaos_points = 10
        self.global_impact = 0

    def perform_action(self, legacy_impact: int, chaos_impact: int):
        """Apply player actions and scale with Golden Ratio."""
        self.legacy_points += phi_scale(legacy_impact)
        self.chaos_points += phi_scale(chaos_impact)
        self.xp += int((legacy_impact + chaos_impact) * GOLDEN_RATIO)

    def calculate_harmony_index(self):
        return calculate_harmony_index(self.legacy_points, self.chaos_points)

    def update_global_impact(self, amount):
        """Track global impact contributions to debt reduction."""
        self.global_impact += amount

    def display_stats(self):
        return {
            "username": self.username,
            "xp": self.xp,
            "legacy_points": self.legacy_points,
            "chaos_points": self.chaos_points,
            "global_impact": self.global_impact,
        }

3. AI-Driven Ethical Scenario Generation

Scenarios are dynamically generated based on player actions, health metrics, and progress. The Riemann Hypothesis, P vs NP, and other breakthroughs influence the logic behind these decisions, ensuring that the scenarios align with real-world complexities.

# ai/scenario.py
from core.golden_ratio import phi_scale
from core.ai_modules import RiemannHypothesis, YangMills

class ScenarioGenerator:
    def generate_scenario(self, health_data: dict, player_xp: int):
        stress = health_data.get("mental", {}).get("stress_level", 0)
        posture = health_data.get("physical", {}).get("posture_score", 0)

        # Example scenarios based on player state
        if stress > 7:
            return {
                "title": "Stress Management",
                "description": "Engage in activities to reduce stress.",
                "legacy_impact": phi_scale(20),
                "chaos_impact": phi_scale(10),
            }
        elif posture < 5:
            return {
                "title": "Posture Perfection",
                "description": "Improve posture through exercises.",
                "legacy_impact": phi_scale(25),
                "chaos_impact": phi_scale(5),
            }
        else:
            return {
                "title": "Legacy Adventure",
                "description": "Embark on an adventure to create your legacy.",
                "legacy_impact": phi_scale(30),
                "chaos_impact": phi_scale(15),
            }

    def apply_mathematical_model(self, player_xp: int):
        """Incorporate Riemann Hypothesis and Yang-Mills models for deeper scenario generation."""
        rh = RiemannHypothesis()
        ym = YangMills()
        result = rh.evaluate(player_xp)
        if result:
            return ym.calculate_mass_gap(result)
        return None

4. WebSocket Multiplayer Support

Real-time multiplayer support using WebSockets, allowing players to collaborate or compete in scenarios. This interaction influences global debt reduction and scenario outcomes.

# multiplayer/websocket.py
from fastapi import WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect

connected_clients = []

async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    connected_clients.append(websocket)
    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            for client in connected_clients:
                await client.send_text(data)
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        connected_clients.remove(websocket)


---

5. Data Visualization

Using Plotly for dynamic visualizations of health metrics, player progress, and global impact contributions.

# visualization/trends.py
import plotly.graph_objects as go

def visualize_health_trends(health_data_history):
    timestamps = [entry["timestamp"] for entry in health_data_history]
    stress_levels = [entry["mental"]["stress_level"] for entry in health_data_history]
    bmi_values = [entry["physical"]["bmi"] for entry in health_data_history]

    fig = go.Figure()
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=timestamps, y=stress_levels, mode="lines+markers", name="Stress Level"))
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=timestamps, y=bmi_values, mode="lines+markers", name="BMI"))

    fig.update_layout(
        title="Health Trends Over Time",
        xaxis_title="Time",
        yaxis_title="Values",
    )
    fig.show()

def visualize_global_impact(player_data):
    fig = go.Figure(go.Bar(
        x=[player_data["username"]],
        y=[player_data["global_impact"]],
        name="Global Impact",
    ))
    fig.update_layout(title="Global Impact Contribution")
    fig.show()


---

6. API Endpoints

API endpoints for accessing player stats, generating scenarios, and handling health data.

# api/endpoints.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
from core.player import Player
from ai.scenario import ScenarioGenerator

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/player/stats")
async def player_stats(player: Player):
    return player.display_stats()

@router.post("/scenario/generate")
async def generate_scenario(health_data: dict, player_xp: int):
    generator = ScenarioGenerator()
    return generator.generate_scenario(health_data, player_xp)

@router.post("/global-impact")
async def update_global_impact(player: Player, impact_amount: float):
    player.update_global_impact(impact_amount)
    return {"message": "Global impact updated.", "new_total": player.global_impact}


---

2. Cloud Deployment:

Deploy the backend services on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud using Kubernetes for auto-scaling and Docker for containerization.



3. Performance Optimization:

Optimize the backend using Redis caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., scenario generation, player stats).



4. Real-Time Analytics:

Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for real-time performance monitoring, tracking of global debt reduction, and player contributions.



5. Testing:

Implement unit and integration testing with pytest to ensure that the Golden Ratio mechanics, health data integration, and scenario generation work as expected.

Additional Enhancements:

Quantum Computing Integration: Use quantum computing breakthroughs (e.g., Riemann Hypothesis, P vs NP) to enhance AI-driven decision-making and optimize global debt reduction models.

Health Integration: Real-time integration with health wearables (Fitbit, Apple Health) to tailor scenarios and monitor real-world health progress.

Global Impact Contributions: Implement a global debt tracker that visualizes how player actions contribute to reducing the $315 trillion global debt.
