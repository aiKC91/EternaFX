Certainly! Here’s a simple HTML representation of the UI:

```html

    <style>
        body {
            background-color: #222;
            color: white;
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        h1 {
            font-weight: bold;
        }
        .definition {
            margin-left: 20px;
        }
        .equation {
            font-style: italic;
            margin-left: 40px;
        }
        .note {
            margin-top: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>1. Understanding Prime Gaps:</h1>
    <div class="definition">
        <p>◦ A <strong>prime gap</strong> is the difference between consecutive primes, defined as:</p>

### Summary of Order of Operations:

1. **Understanding Prime Gaps**:
   - Define what a prime gap is: the difference between consecutive prime numbers.
   - Use the formula \( g_n = p_{n+1} - p_n \) to calculate the gap.

2. **Observations**:
   - Prime gaps appear irregular for small primes.
   - As numbers grow, gaps increase on average.
   - Gaps can cluster or exhibit patterns as they grow larger.
