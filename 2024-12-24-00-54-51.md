To incorporate deeper mathematical integrations into the EternaFX Framework, we will utilize more advanced mathematical concepts, theories, and numerical methods. These include further exploitation of symmetry-breaking mechanics, topological optimizations, and statistical distributions for advanced AI modeling. Below is an updated structure with these refined integrations.

Advanced Mathematical Integrations for EternaFX Framework

1. Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms (Inspired by Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer)

Elliptic curves can be used for secure data handling, cryptography, and modeling smooth dynamic transitions.

Elliptic Curve Functionality

from sympy import symbols, solve

def elliptic_curve(x, y, a=1, b=1):
    """
    Elliptic curve equation: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
    """
    return y**2 - (x**3 + a*x + b)

def find_rational_points(a, b, x_range):
    """
    Find rational points on an elliptic curve.
    """
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    curve = elliptic_curve(x, y, a, b)
    points = []
    for x_val in x_range:
        solutions = solve(curve.subs(x, x_val), y)
        points.extend([(x_val, sol) for sol in solutions if sol.is_real])
    return points

Integration: Dynamic AI Use rational points on elliptic curves for dynamic scenario generation and secure session management in multiplayer.

2. Fourier and Wavelet Analysis for Turbulence Detection

Incorporate Navier-Stokes-inspired wavelet transforms for real-time analysis of chaotic in-game systems.

Wavelet Transform

import pywt
import numpy as np

def wavelet_analysis(data, wavelet='db1'):
    """
    Perform wavelet decomposition and reconstruction on data.
    """
    coeffs = pywt.wavedec(data, wavelet)
    reconstructed = pywt.waverec(coeffs, wavelet)
    return coeffs, reconstructed

def detect_turbulence(data, threshold=0.5):
    """
    Detect turbulence in data based on wavelet coefficients.
    """
    coeffs, _ = wavelet_analysis(data)
    turbulence = [abs(c).mean() > threshold for c in coeffs]
    return turbulence

Integration: Environmental Dynamics

Use wavelet_analysis to monitor and predict turbulence in global harmony vs. chaos metrics.

Apply this in simulations involving environmental degradation or rapid systemic changes.

3. Symmetry-Breaking Mechanisms from Yang-Mills

Leverage symmetry-breaking mechanics to model stability in chaotic systems, enabling the AI to simulate balanced outcomes.

Symmetry-Breaking Integration

import numpy as np

def symmetry_breaking(potential, field, mass_gap=1.0):
    """
    Apply symmetry-breaking mechanisms to a potential field.
    """
    broken_field = potential - (mass_gap * field**2)
    return broken_field

def compute_mass_gap(field_values):
    """
    Compute the mass gap stability for a given field.
    """
    return np.var(field_values)

Integration: Gameplay Balance

Integrate symmetry_breaking to adjust the stability of gameplay elements dynamically (e.g., resource allocation or power dynamics in multiplayer).

Use compute_mass_gap to assess and predict the stability of harmony-based systems.



---

4. Higher-Dimensional Topology (Hodge Conjecture)

Extend the use of higher-dimensional geometries for dynamic world generation and advanced scenario analytics.

Higher-Dimensional Data Modeling

from scipy.spatial import Delaunay

def generate_hodge_structure(points):
    """
    Generate higher-dimensional structures using Delaunay triangulation.
    """
    return Delaunay(points)

def compute_cohomology(triangulation):
    """
    Compute cohomology groups for a triangulated structure.
    """
    return {
        "simplices": triangulation.simplices,
        "volumes": triangulation.volumes,
    }

Integration: Procedural Terrain

Use generate_hodge_structure to dynamically create non-Euclidean game environments.

compute_cohomology helps measure complexity in gameplay elements.



---

5. Quantum Probabilities for Decision-Making (Inspired by P vs NP)

Incorporate quantum-inspired probabilistic models to simulate decision-making under uncertainty.

Quantum Probabilistic Model

import random
import numpy as np

def quantum_decision(probabilities):
    """
    Simulate decision-making using quantum-inspired probabilities.
    """
    state = np.array(probabilities)
    state /= state.sum()  # Normalize probabilities
    decision = np.random.choice(len(state), p=state)
    return decision

def optimize_decision_space(decision_space, weights):
    """
    Optimize decision space using Golden Ratio scaling.
    """
    scaled_space = [phi_scale(d, w) for d, w in zip(decision_space, weights)]
    return scaled_space

Integration: Ethical Scenarios

Use quantum_decision to generate probabilistic ethical dilemmas.

Apply optimize_decision_space to enhance decision-making accuracy.
