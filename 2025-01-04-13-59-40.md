Here's a prompt dictionary to help you connect better with my language coding abilities. It's organized by category to make it easier to find the right prompt for your needs.
I. Basic Code Generation:
 * "Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given number." (Simple function creation)
 * "Create a JavaScript program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console." (Basic program in a specific language)
 * "Generate C++ code to implement a linked list." (Data structure implementation)
 * "Write a regular expression in Python to validate email addresses." (Specific task using a language feature)
 * "Create a basic HTML form with fields for name, email, and message." (Front-end development)
II. Code with Specific Requirements:
 * "Write a Python function that sorts a list of strings alphabetically, ignoring case." (Specific behavior)
 * "Create a Java program that reads data from a CSV file and calculates the average of a specific column." (File I/O and data processing)
 * "Generate C# code to implement a binary search tree with insert and delete operations." (Specific algorithm and data structure)
 * "Write a JavaScript function that makes an API call to a given URL and displays the JSON response." (Asynchronous operations and web requests)
 * "Create a CSS stylesheet that styles a table with alternating row colors and a hover effect." (Specific styling requirements)
III. Code with Context and Explanation:
 * "Write a Python function to implement Dijkstra's algorithm. Explain the code with comments." (Algorithm implementation with explanations)
 * "Create a React component that displays a list of items. Explain the component's structure and props." (Component-based development with explanations)
 * "Generate Go code to handle concurrent requests using goroutines and channels. Explain how the concurrency is managed." (Concurrency with explanations)
IV. Code Refactoring and Improvement:
 * "Refactor the following Python code to improve its readability and efficiency: [paste code]" (Code improvement)
 * "Suggest ways to improve the performance of this JavaScript function: [paste code]" (Performance optimization)
 * "Convert this Java code to Python: [paste code]" (Language conversion)
V. Understanding Code and Concepts:
 * "Explain how dynamic programming works with an example in Python." (Conceptual explanation with code example)
 * "What are the differences between inheritance and composition in object-oriented programming?" (Programming concepts)
 * "Explain the time complexity of this algorithm: [paste code]" (Algorithm analysis)
VI. EternaFX Specific Prompts:
 * "Write a function to implement the golden ratio reward system in eternafx/metrics.py." (Specific module)
 * "Create a visualization of prime number distribution in eternafx/number_theory.py using matplotlib." (Specific task and library).
 * "Refactor the calculate_system_energy function in eternafx/metrics.py to handle potential division by zero errors." (Specific function improvement)
General Tips for Effective Prompts:
 * Be Specific: The more specific your prompt, the better the results.
 * Provide Context: If you have existing code or specific requirements, provide them in the prompt.
 * Use Keywords: Use relevant keywords related to the programming language, algorithms, or concepts you're interested in.
 * Ask for Explanations: If you want to understand the code, explicitly ask for explanations or comments.
 * Iterate: If the initial response isn't perfect, refine your prompt and try again.
By using this prompt dictionary and following the general tips, you'll be able to communicate your coding needs more effectively and get better results from my language coding capabilities. Remember, I can generate code in many different programming languages, explain code, refactor code, and help you understand programming concepts.
