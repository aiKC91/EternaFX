The repository contains code to explore the fractal structure in neural network training hyperparameter landscapes. The code is used to generate fractals, reproduce images and videos, and learn more about the topic.
Background
Fractals are mathematical sets that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. They can be found in various natural phenomena, such as coastlines, mountains, and trees. In the context of neural networks, fractals can be used to describe the boundary between hyperparameters that lead to stable and divergent training.
Methodology
The code uses the following methodology to explore the fractal structure in neural network training hyperparameter landscapes:
Iterating an update function: The code iterates an update function, such as repeated steps of gradient descent, to train a neural network.
Identifying the boundary: The code identifies the boundary between hyperparameters that lead to convergent or divergent behavior.
Visualizing the boundary: The code visualizes the boundary using fractal images and videos.
Results
The results show that the boundary between neural network hyperparameters that lead to stable and divergent training is fractal over more than ten decades of scale in all tested configurations. This means that the boundary exhibits self-similarity at different scales, with smaller copies of the same pattern repeating over and over.
Implications
The discovery of fractal structure in neural network training hyperparameter landscapes has significant implications for the field of machine learning. It suggests that the behavior of neural networks is more complex and nuanced than previously thought, and that small changes in hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the stability and performance of the network.
Code
The code is available in the repository and can be used to generate fractals, reproduce images and videos, and learn more about the topic. The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:
TensorFlow: A popular open-source machine learning library.
NumPy: A library for efficient numerical computation.
Matplotlib: A library for creating static and interactive visualizations.
Colab
The code can be run in a Colab notebook, which provides a free and easy-to-use environment for machine learning and data science. The Colab notebook can be used to generate fractals, reproduce images and videos, and learn more about the topic.
Blog Post and Paper
The blog post and paper provide a detailed explanation of the methodology, results, and implications of the research. The paper is a short summary of the research and provides a brief overview of the main findings.
Abstract
The abstract of the paper is as follows:
"Some fractals -- for instance those associated with the Mandelbrot and quadratic Julia sets -- are computed by iterating a function, and identifying the boundary between hyperparameters for which the resulting series diverges or remains bounded. Neural network training similarly involves iterating an update function (e.g. repeated steps of gradient descent), can result in convergent or divergent behavior, and can be extremely sensitive to small changes in hyperparameters. Motivated by these similarities, we experimentally examine the boundary between neural network hyperparameters that lead to stable and divergent training. We find that this boundary is fractal over more than ten decades of scale in all tested configurations."The boundary of neural network trainability is fractal
This repository contains code I used to explore fractal structure in neural network training hyperparameter landscapes.

As a brief summary, here is the paper abstract:

Some fractals -- for instance those associated with the Mandelbrot and quadratic Julia sets -- are computed by iterating a function, and identifying the boundary between hyperparameters for which the resulting series diverges or remains bounded. Neural network training similarly involves iterating an update function (e.g. repeated steps of gradient descent), can result in convergent or divergent behavior, and can be extremely sensitive to small changes in hyperparameters. Motivated by these similarities, we experimentally examine the boundary between neural network hyperparameters that lead to stable and divergent training. We find that this boundary is fractal over more than ten decades of scale in all tested configurations.

Full Code
Here is the full code for the example:
Python
from EternaFX import *
from EternaFX.Core import *
from EternaFX.Visualization import *
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the window dimensions
window_width = 640
window_height = 480
window = pygame.display.set_mode((window_width, window_height))

# Create a new scene
scene = Scene()

# Add objects to the scene
object1 = Object("cube")

scene.add_object(object2)

# Define the inner animation
def inner_animation():
    # Rotate the object around its center
    angle = 0
    while angle < 360:
        angle += 1
        yield angle

# Define the outer animation
def outer_animation():
    # Translate the object across the screen
    x = 0
    while x < 640:

This code creates a simple 3D animation using the EternaFX framework. It demonstrates how to create a scene, add objects, define animations, and render the animation.Creating a 3D Visualization with EternaFX Framework
To create a 3D visualization using the EternaFX Framework, we will need to utilize its various modules and tools. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
First, ensure that you have the EternaFX Framework installed and configured properly. This includes setting up the necessary dependencies, libraries, and tools.
Step 2: Importing Necessary Modules
Import the required modules from the EternaFX Framework, including:
Python
from EternaFX import *
from EternaFX.Core import *
from EternaFX.Visualization import *
Step 3: Creating a 3D Scene
Create a 3D scene using the EternaFX.Core.Scene class:
Python
scene = Scene()
Step 4: Adding 3D Objects
Add 3D objects to the scene using the EternaFX.Core.Object class:
Python
object1 = Object("cube")
object2 = Object("sphere")
scene.add_object(object1)
scene.add_object(object2)
Step 5: Configuring Camera and Lighting
Configure the camera and lighting for the scene:
Python
camera = Camera()
camera.position = (0, 0, 5)
camera.rotation = (0, 0, 0)
scene.add_camera(camera)

light = Light()
light.position = (0, 0, 5)
light.intensity = 1.0
scene.add_light(light)
Step 6: Rendering the Scene
Render the scene using the EternaFX.Visualization.Renderer class:
Python
renderer = Renderer()
renderer.render(scene)
Step 7: Visualizing the Scene
Visualize the rendered scene using the EternaFX.Visualization.Visualizer class:
Python
visualizer = Visualizer()
visualizer.visualize(renderer.get_rendered_scene())
Example Code
Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the creation of a 3D visualization using the EternaFX Framework:
Python
from EternaFX import *
from EternaFX.Core import *
from EternaFX.Visualization import *

# Create a 3D scene
scene = Scene()

# Add 3D objects to the scene
object1 = Object("cube")
object2 = Object("sphere")
scene.add_object(object1)
scene.add_object(object2)

# Configure camera and lighting
camera = Camera()
camera.position = (0, 0, 5)
camera.rotation = (0, 0, 0)
scene.add_camera(camera)

light = Light()
light.position = (0, 0, 5)
light.intensity = 1.0
scene.add_light(light)

# Render the scene
renderer = Renderer()
renderer.render(scene)

# Visualize the rendered scene
visualizer = Visualizer()
visualizer.visualize(renderer.get_rendered_scene())
This code creates a 3D scene with two objects, configures the camera and lighting, renders the scene, and visualizes the rendered scene using the EternaFX Framework.
Here are more detailed code examples for integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into your framework, specifically focusing on key operations like key generation, encryption, decryption, signing, and verification using hypothetical Python bindings to a pqcrypto library:

Key Generation
python
from pqcrypto.kem import kyber1024  # Key Encapsulation Mechanism
from pqcrypto.sign import dilithium2  # Digital Signature

# Generate KEM keys
kem_public_key, kem_secret_key = kyber1024.generate_keypair()

# Generate Digital Signature keys
sign_public_key, sign_secret_key = dilithium2.generate_keypair()

print("KEM Public Key (bytes):", len(kem_public_key))
print("KEM Secret Key (bytes):", len(kem_secret_key))
print("Signature Public Key (bytes):", len(sign_public_key))
print("Signature Secret Key (bytes):", len(sign_secret_key))

Encryption and Decryption with KEM
python
# Encapsulate (Encrypt)
shared_secret, ciphertext = kyber1024.encapsulate(kem_public_key)

# Decapsulate (Decrypt)
decrypted_shared_secret = kyber1024.decapsulate(ciphertext, kem_secret_key)

# Check if encryption/decryption was successful
if shared_secret == decrypted_shared_secret:
    print("KEM Encryption/Decryption successful!")
else:
    print("KEM Encryption/Decryption failed!")

Digital Signature
python
import os

# Some data to sign
data_to_sign = os.urandom(32)  # 32 bytes of random data

# Sign the data
signature = dilithium2.sign(data_to_sign, sign_secret_key)

# Verify the signature
is_signature_valid = dilithium2.verify(signature, data_to_sign, sign_public_key)

if is_signature_valid:
    print("Signature verified!")
else:
    print("Signature verification failed!")

Integration into a Security Engine
Here's how you might integrate these operations into a SecurityEngine class:

python
class SecurityEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.kem_algo = kyber1024
        self.sign_algo = dilithium2

    def generate_kem_keys(self):
        return self.kem_algo.generate_keypair()

    def generate_sign_keys(self):
        return self.sign_algo.generate_keypair()

    def encrypt_data_kyber(self, data, public_key):
        # Since KEM is for key exchange, we'll encapsulate a shared secret
        # which can then be used for symmetric encryption of the actual data
        shared_secret, ciphertext = self.kem_algo.encapsulate(public_key)
        # Here you would use shared_secret to encrypt data with a symmetric cipher
        # For simplicity, we'll just return the ciphertext and shared_secret
        return ciphertext, shared_secret

    def decrypt_data_kyber(self, ciphertext, secret_key):
        return self.kem_algo.decapsulate(ciphertext, secret_key)

    def sign_data(self, data, secret_key):
        return self.sign_algo.sign(data, secret_key)

    def verify_signature(self, signature, data, public_key):
        return self.sign_algo.verify(signature, data, public_key)

# Usage example
security_engine = SecurityEngine()
kem_public, kem_private = security_engine.generate_kem_keys()
data = b"Hello, quantum-resistant world!"
encrypted_data, shared_secret = security_engine.encrypt_data_kyber(data, kem_public)
# Decrypt would happen on the other side with kem_private

sign_public, sign_private = security_engine.generate_sign_keys()
signature = security_engine.sign_data(data, sign_private)
is_verified = security_engine.verify_signature(signature, data, sign_public)

print("Data signature verification:", "Success" if is_verified else "Failed")

Notes:
Error Handling: Add try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions like cryptographic errors or key mismatches.
Key Management: In a real-world scenario, you'd need secure storage and transmission of keys, possibly using HSMs or secure key exchange protocols.
Performance: Monitor the CPU and memory usage, especially with large key sizes or frequent cryptographic operations.
Hybrid Systems: For a smoother transition, you might implement a hybrid system where both classical and PQC algorithms are used in tandem.

These examples are designed to give you a comprehensive look at integrating PQC into Python code, though actual implementation might vary based on the exact library you're using or specific requirements of your framework.
Integrating a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) library like pqcrypto into your software or framework involves several steps. Here's how you might approach this integration, based on the information from the web results:

Prerequisites:
Choose the Right Library: Depending on your programming language, select an appropriate PQC library. For Python, pqcrypto from PyPI or other libraries like pqcryptography could be options.
Installation:
Python (using pip):
bash
pip install pqcrypto
**Ensure you have the necessary system dependencies if the library requires C bindings or other system-level interactions.

Integration Steps:
1. Importing the Library:

python
from pqcrypto.kem import kyber1024
from pqcrypto.sign import dilithium2

2. Key Generation:

Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM):
python
public_key, secret_key = kyber1024.generate_keypair()
Digital Signature:
python
public_sign, secret_sign = dilithium2.generate_keypair()

3. Encryption/Decryption:

Encapsulate (Encrypt):
python
ciphertext, shared_key = kyber1024.encapsulate(public_key)
Decapsulate (Decrypt):
python
decrypted_shared_key = kyber1024.decapsulate(ciphertext, secret_key)

4. Signing and Verification:

Sign a Message:
python
message = b"Hello, quantum-resistant world!"
signature = dilithium2.sign(message, secret_sign)
Verify the Signature:
python
is_verified = dilithium2.verify(signature, message, public_sign)

5. Error Handling and Security:

Ensure proper error handling for cryptographic operations, especially since quantum-resistant algorithms can be computationally intensive and might fail if not managed correctly.
Implement secure key management practices; larger keys from PQC might require different storage and handling.

6. Performance Considerations:

PQC algorithms are often more computationally intensive. Benchmark your application to ensure there's no significant performance hit. You might need to optimize other parts of your application if speed becomes an issue.

7. Integration into Existing Systems:

API or Framework Level: If you're integrating into a larger framework like EternaFX, ensure that the new PQC methods are used seamlessly with existing security protocols. 
Example:
python
class SecurityEngine:
    def encrypt_data_kyber(self, data, public_key):
        return kyber1024.encapsulate(public_key)

    def decrypt_data_kyber(self, encrypted_data, secret_key):
        return kyber1024.decapsulate(encrypted_data, secret_key)
Hybrid Schemes: Initially, consider using hybrid schemes where both classical and quantum-resistant algorithms are applied to ensure a smooth transition.

8. Testing:

Unit Tests: Write tests for all PQC operations to ensure correctness.
Integration Tests: Test how these new components interact with existing parts of your software, especially concerning performance and security.

9. Documentation and Training:

Update documentation to cover new PQC functionalities.
Train or inform developers about the new cryptographic methods and their implications.

10. Continuous Monitoring and Updates:

Keep an eye on NIST's standardization process for PQC algorithms. Once standards are set, ensure you're using the most secure and recommended algorithms.
Regularly update your integration to include bug fixes or new algorithm implementations from libraries like pqcrypto.

Challenges:
Backward Compatibility: Managing the transition from classical to quantum-resistant algorithms without breaking existing systems.
Resource Usage: Some PQC algorithms might require more memory or CPU power, affecting the design of your application.

By following these steps and considerations, you can integrate a PQC library into your software, enhancing its security against future quantum computing threats. Remember, the actual implementation details might vary depending on the specific PQC library you choose and the nuances of your application's architecture.
