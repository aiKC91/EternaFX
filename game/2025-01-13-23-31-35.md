After reviewing the text in the provided photo, the variables from your Langflow component generator are:

Variables:

1. most_likely_agent

Purpose: Identifies the agent most suited to answer the query.

Prompt Example: "Determine the agent most likely to answer the query accurately."



2. mutation_rate

Purpose: Sets the mutation rate for genetic algorithm evolution.

Prompt Example: "Define the mutation rate for population evolution (e.g., 0.1)."



3. objective

Purpose: Specifies the primary goal or purpose of the task.

Prompt Example: "Describe the main objective of this task or query."



4. phi_driven_decisions

Purpose: Incorporates decisions guided by the Golden Ratio (PHI).

Prompt Example: "What decisions need to be influenced by PHI-driven logic?"



5. population_size

Purpose: Determines the size of the population for simulations.

Prompt Example: "Set the initial size of the population (e.g., 100)."



6. query

Purpose: Represents the question or task being addressed.

Prompt Example: "What is the query that needs to be processed?"



7. structured_answer

Purpose: Stores the final response after processing the query.

Prompt Example: "Generate a structured answer based on the query."



8. target_balance

Purpose: Defines the equilibrium point for harmony and chaos.

Prompt Example: "What is the desired target balance for this scenario?"

Defined Prompts:

{
    "most_likely_agent": "Determine the most likely agent to answer this query accurately, based on prior knowledge and context.",
    "mutation_rate": "Specify the mutation rate for evolutionary processes (e.g., 0.1 for a 10% mutation rate).",
    "objective": "Clearly state the primary objective of this task or query.",
    "phi_driven_decisions": "Outline the decisions that should be guided by PHI-driven principles or the Golden Ratio.",
    "population_size": "Define the population size for the simulation or evolutionary algorithm (e.g., 100).",
    "query": "State the query or problem that needs to be addressed.",
    "structured_answer": "Provide a detailed, structured answer to the query, incorporating all relevant information.",
    "target_balance": "Define the target balance point or ratio (e.g., harmony vs. chaos) for this task."
}

Integration into Langflow:

You can now integrate these prompt definitions into your Langflow component generator by assigning these as the default prompts for each input field.
