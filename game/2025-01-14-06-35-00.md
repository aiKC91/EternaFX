Explanation of the Code

The EternaFXPromptTemplate class is a dynamic and interactive framework designed for generating prompts, visualizing complex mathematical structures, and managing the state of the EternaFX universe. Here's a detailed breakdown of the functionality:


---

1. Features and Functionality

Dynamic Variable Management

Variables: The framework maintains a dictionary of dynamic variables, such as player_name, harmony_index, elliptic_parameters, etc.

Update Variables: The update_variable method allows you to modify these variables during runtime.


Prompt Generation

Custom Prompts: The generate_prompt method dynamically incorporates the current state of variables into a narrative-style prompt.

Logging: The log_prompt method prints and returns the generated prompt for debugging or display purposes.


Zeta Function Visualization

Interactive 3D Plot: The visualize_zeta_function method uses Plotly to render a 3D visualization of the Zeta Function over a complex grid. This includes dynamic axes labels for better user experience.


Elliptic Curve Parameters

The EllipticParameters class manages the a and b parameters for elliptic curve computations. These can be updated and referenced in the prompts.


Zeta Function Computation

The zeta_function method computes values of the Zeta Function for any complex input s, leveraging mathematical expressions.

2. Usage Instructions

Setup

1. Instantiate the Class:

eternafx = EternaFXPromptTemplate()


2. Update Variables Dynamically: Use update_variable to change any aspect of the EternaFX state, such as the player name, generation, or Zeta Function values.

eternafx.update_variable("player_name", "Elliot")
eternafx.update_variable("harmony_index", 2.5)



Generate Prompts

Generate and log prompts with the current state:

eternafx.log_prompt()


Visualize the Zeta Function

Render a 3D heatmap of the Zeta Function:

eternafx.visualize_zeta_function()


Integrate Mathematical Insights

Update the elliptic curve parameters for more mathematical relevance:

eternafx.update_variable("elliptic_parameters", EllipticParameters(1.0, 2.0))

3. Key Features for Deployment

Interactivity

Allows for real-time updates and dynamic interaction with the Zeta Function and elliptic curve parameters.


Expandability

Add new dynamic variables or expand existing methods to integrate additional features such as player progression, scenario-based decision-making, or advanced mathematical constructs.


Visualization

Uses Plotly for high-quality, interactive, and shareable visualizations.


Modularity

Cleanly separates variable management, visualization, and computation into distinct methods for maintainability.
