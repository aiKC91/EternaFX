The text in the image discusses a VR-related question and response:

1. Casey Clark's Question:

"Is this like a '3D street art' version of eye-tracking with visualization through a projector?"



2. Kevin John's Response:

"Actually, yes, it's like a 3D street art. You need a tracker which is to be attached to your head, which they are providing, known as VIVE Tracker. Based on that, the perspective changes. Unfortunately, this works best when there is only one person. They do have an eye-tracking version of it also."
