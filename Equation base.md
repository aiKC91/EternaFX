Core Framework Equation

The EternaFX System Equation integrates these components as follows:

\mathcal{E}(x, y, t) = \Phi \cdot \left( \mathcal{P}_{NP} \cdot \mathcal{B}_{SD} \cdot Y_{M} \right) + \int_{0}^{t} \left[ \mathcal{H}(f) \cdot \mathcal{D}(t) \right] \, dt + \mathcal{C}(x, t)

Breaking It Down

1. Golden Ratio Scaling

The Golden Ratio () governs the proportionality between system components:

\Phi = \frac{\text{Optimal Value}}{\text{Baseline Value}}

2. Optimization Subsystem

The product  combines critical optimization terms:

\mathcal{P}_{NP} = \frac{\text{P-Solvable Complexity}}{\text{NP-Hard Complexity}}, \quad \mathcal{B}_{SD} = \frac{\text{Rank of Elliptic Curves}}{\text{Expected Rank}}, \quad Y_{M} = \frac{\text{Field Energy}}{\text{Quantum Gap}}

3. Error Accumulation and Resonance

The integral term accumulates error diagnostics () over time, weighted by harmonic resonance ():

\int_{0}^{t} \mathcal{H}(f) \cdot \mathcal{D}(t) \, dt

4. Adaptive Error Correction

The correction term  adjusts dynamically:

\mathcal{C}(x, t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \mathcal{L}(x, t) - \Phi \cdot \mathcal{D}(t)

5. Visualization Output

The system visualizes the overall performance with:

\mathcal{V}(t) = \frac{\mathcal{E}(x, y, t)}{\Phi}
